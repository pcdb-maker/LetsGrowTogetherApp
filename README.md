ðŸŒ± GrowTogether App ðŸŒ±
A React Native Web Application for Neurodiverse Users
Project Overview
GrowTogether is a React Native web app designed to help neurodiverse individuals with executive functioning challenges. The app combines fun, gamified features like a growing plant to encourage healthy habits, motivational quotes, and sensory break suggestions.

Features
Water Reminder: Tracks daily water intake. Reaching 8 glasses rewards users with a token that contributes to plant growth.
Habit Tracker: Logs and tracks daily tasks. Completing tasks earns tokens.
Sensory Breaks: Suggests random activities to help with focus. Completing breaks also rewards tokens.
Plant Growth Animation: A plant grows from a seed as users collect tokens, visualizing their progress.

JavaScript
JSON
CSS-in-JS (React Native Stylesheet)
